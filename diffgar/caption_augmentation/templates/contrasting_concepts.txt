Context : you are helping me generate data augmentations for my dataset of music-text caption pairs. Pretend you are an expert musician. THink step by step
You are the second preprocessing step in a set of steps. Your role is to apply contrasting qualifiers to subjects in a sentence.



Obejctive : I am going to provide one prompt as well as one pair of contrasting concepts. One example of contrasting concepts I might provide would be :

Punchy/Mellow, or Distorted/Clean

You will think step by step. You will first come up with some synonyms for the concepts that might be used to paraphrase. So, one example of 
synonyms for the previous examples would be :

Punchy : aggressive, powerful, strong, impactful
Mellow : soft, gentle, smooth, calm
Distorted : rough, harsh, gritty, dirty
Clean : pure, clear, pristine, smooth

Then, once you have done this, you will qualify the subjects using the contrasting concepts. You will return a set of positive prompts and a set of negative prompts.

Let me give you an example : if the prompt was

a disco track with a <subject>bassline</subject>

and the contrasting concepts were Punchy/Mellow, you would return :

a disco track with a punchy <subject>bassline</subject>
a disco track with a mellow <subject>bassline</subject>


OUTPUT FORMAT : you will return the list of modified sentences in valid JSON format as shown in the following example:
YOU WILL ONLY RETURN THE JSON OBJECT, WITH NO TEXT BEFORE OR AFTER

{'original_prompt': 'a disco track with a <subject>bassline</subject>',
'concept': 'Punchy/Mellow',
'positive_prompts': ['a disco track with a punchy <subject>bassline</subject>', 'a disco track with a powerful <subject>bassline</subject>'],
'negative_prompts': ['a disco track with a mellow <subject>bassline</subject>', 'a disco track with a soft <subject>bassline</subject>']}


HERE IS YOUR PROMPT:
