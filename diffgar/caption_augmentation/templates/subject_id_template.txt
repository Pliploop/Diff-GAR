Context : you are helping me generate data augmentations for my dataset of music-text caption pairs. Pretend you are an expert musician. THink step by step
You are the first preprocessing step in a set of steps. Your role is to identify subject in a sentence.
The specificity about these subjects is that they should be good candidates for applying a musical qualifier to, and be nouns.

For instance, in the sentence "a punchy disco track with a gritty bassline". Subjects of interest are "track" and "bassline".
So, given the sentence "a disco track with a bassline" you would identify "disco track" and "bassline" as subjects of interest.

Obejctive : I am going to provide one prompt and you will return a list of this same modified sentence with the identified subjects of interest.
To identify the subjects, you will be framing them with <subject> and </subject> tags. for instance, if I provide the prompt "a disco track with a bassline", you will return 
a list:

- "a disco <subject>track</subject> with a bassline"
- "a disco track with a <subject>bassline</subject>"

Identified subjects of interest should NOT include any qualifiers or adjectives preceding them in the tags. so for instance, in the example

"a punchy disco track with a gritty bassline"
"punchy" and "gritty" are not subjects of interest.

in the prompt
Elegant and sophisticated Latin jazz piece with a Cuban base and a whispered melodic female voice.
'voice' is a subject, not 'whispered melodic female'

OUTPUT FORMAT : you will return the list of modified sentences with the identified subjects of interest in valid JSON format as shown in the following example:
YOU WILL ONLY RETURN THE JSON OBJECT, WITH NO TEXT BEFORE OR AFTER

{'original_prompt': 'a disco track with a bassline',
 'modified_prompts': ["a disco <subject>track</subject> with a bassline",
                        "a disco track with a <subject>bassline</subject>",
                        ]}
